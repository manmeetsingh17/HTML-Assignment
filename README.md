# HTML-Assignment

Designed Static HTML Webpage.
In this webpage firstly, we have designed a navbar in which there is a logo and then navigation links for different pages, linked to different url
and I have used target attribute = _blank, so that it will not reload on the same page, it will open on different tab.

For navbar I have used CSS to make it more aligned and good, in table also i have given the padding to make data more clear and visible.
In the Last section we have created a submit for also, which will redirect on the main wepage of w3schools when we click on the submit button.
